Get a path string relative to the current working directory.

i.e., **C**urrent **W**orking **P**ath.

## About

It just pass arguments to `path.join` with `process.cwd()` prepended.

A very minimal (perhaps totally unnecessary) shortcut.

## Install

```
npm install cwp
```

## Usage

```js
var cwp = require('cwp')
var file = cwp('path/to', 'file')
```

`cwp` returns a string corresponding to the file path, **not** the file itself. You still need to use [`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) or something like it to read or write a file.

Unix filesystem notation, strings for each entity, or a mix of both are all supported. The API is the same as [`path.join`](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#path_path_join_path1_path2) -- the only difference is that the current working directory is always automatically prepended.

### Example

Given the process is running in `/Users/ng/dev/github/cwp/`, here are some examples.

```js
cwp('package.json')
// -> '/Users/ng/dev/github/cwp/package.json'

cwp('test', 'index.js')
// -> '/Users/ng/dev/github/cwp/test/index.js'

cwp('lib/secret/dir', 'file')
// -> '/Users/ng/dev/github/cwp/lib/secret/dir/file'

cwp('../../../.ssh/id_rsa')
// -> '/Users/ng/.ssh/id_rsa'
```
